# ReadyPy - Python IDE in the Browser

ReadyPy is a Python IDE that runs entirely in the browser. It provides a user-friendly interface for writing, editing, and running Python code without the need to install any software locally. To try out ReadyPy, you can visit the demo website at [readypy.com](https://readypy.com).

## Quick Start

To quickly get started with ReadyPy, follow these steps:

1. Install the latest version of Node.js and npm. You can download them from the official Node.js website: nodejs.org.

2. Clone the ReadyPy repository to your local machine using Git or download the source code as a ZIP file.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you cloned or extracted the ReadyPy source code.

4. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```
npm install
```

5. Once the installation is complete, start the ReadyPy development server by running the following command:

```
npm start
````
This will start the development server and open ReadyPy in your default browser. If the browser doesn't open automatically, you can access ReadyPy by visiting http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
